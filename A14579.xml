            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit that many good and learned men haue made mention in their books of the doctors of the Church of God, yet I haue ben of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it will not be a thing vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this preſent to publiſh vp<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o the like matter this preſent diſcourſe, being collected out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe authours, and compiled in one: after the manner and faſhion that you ſee: deeming that it will be profitable to many who haue not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at wil to read much, to ſee hereby &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of a continuall order of good doctors wh<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o God hath rayſed vp from the beginning of the world vntil this preſent time, &amp; how God hath euerlaſtingly collected for himſelfe a perpetuall Church, through the word of the goſpell, from this maſſe of ſinne, that is to ſay, of men: amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt wh<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o the goſpel which we heare at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hath at all times ſhinned in the middeſt of moſt thicke darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>And hereby we may ſee and vnderſtand, that there neuer hath ben any maner of religon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be, which hath continued ſo long, and hath had ſuch efficacie and vertue, ſo continuall an order, ſuch and ſo wonderful a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the holy ſcriptures, as hath the Church
<pb facs="tcp:19970:4"/>of God had, the which, like as ſhall be ſhewed in the diſcourſe following, God himſelf hath min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded euer ſince the beginning of the worlde to teach &amp; declare by the voice of his own ſon, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his doctrin before by the miniſterie of the holy fathers, Patriarches, Prophetes, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, Prieſtes, and Apoſtles: and laſtly hath conſerued the ſame by a ſingular grace and goodneſſe vntil this preſent time, through faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Biſhops and good paſtours, and doctours of the Church of God being ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, and ſtill placed in the roumes of others their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, the which ſame ſhal be conſerued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, &amp; defended by a ſingular grace and goodnes of God, euen vnto the glorious comming of his ſonne our lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And thus, ſeing that God himſelfe hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed bliſhed and ordeined the miniſtery of his word, which we at this preſent do follow, we nede not to dout but that he doth and will alwaies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the ſame, as may eaſily be vnderſtoode by the effectes of all tymes. For although that the deuill in his enchantmentes hath at all times found out a rage more then horrible againſt the Church and faithfull doctours: like as here is manifeſted by Abel, who was ſlaine by Caine, being moued thereto by a deuiliſh enuie: by the perſecution and oppreſſion of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, by the high prieſtes, who were ſlaine by Saule, by Iſay and Ieremie, who were put to death: by the captiuitie of the people, when they were carried away into Babylon: likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:19970:4"/>by Iohn Baptiſt, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by the Apoſtles who haue beene cruelly ſlayne, and by ſo many millions of Martyrs: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath continued through out all ages, and there haue beene alwayes doctours diuinely rayſed vp in the places of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for to ſet vp agayne and to conſerue the light of the doctrine, to make it ſhine in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of thoſe peoples and Realmes that God woulde haue it. It hath then been alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and defended: for God is the protector and gardein thereof who maketh it to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande all ſuch aſſaultes. And for this cauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in his illuſions of theſe times hath ſuggeſted and put in practyce the moſte cruell tormentes that coulde be deuiſed: but all in vaine. There haue beene kindled fires great and ſmall. There haue beene ſet vp alſo for the true Chriſtians Scaffoldes &amp;c. ſome haue beene caſte into the bottomes of ponds and riuers: and to conclude, Sathan hath by ſword and force vſed all ſortes of moſt cruel violences, for to cauſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſeruice of God might be altogether extinct and buried, but he neuer coulde, neither euer ſhall be able to doe it. Wee muſte then conſider and vnderſtande, that true religion hath of GOD an efficacie and vertue more great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then any thinge that can bee, or euer hath bene, ſeeing that ſo mightie an enemie as ſatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the prince of the children of this world, hath ſo often and ſtrongly beſieged it, and yet coulde neuer hinder, but that alwayes thorough the
<pb facs="tcp:19970:5"/>goodnes of God it ſhoulde be ſet vp.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak of other religions which haue beene, and be, what continuance haue they had? what ſtedfaſtneſſe and aſſurance of the trueth haue beene founde in them? what number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many as were profeſſours of the ſame haue euer beene ſo ſteedfaſt in their religions, that they would euer ſuffer moſt cruell tortures therfore, like as haue done an infinite multitude for the aſſurance and ſteedfaſtneſſe that they had in the trueth, which no man is able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, by whome God woulde be glorified? So many and ſuch manner of religions as haue ben haue they had euer ſuch order, ſuch a doctrine, which hath plainly ſhewed vnto them the truth of the being, of the firſt originall of things that haue bene ſince the beginning of the world, and of thinges that haue come to paſſe, and that bee daily accompliſhed, as God hath made his to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande from time to time, firſt by viſions and oracles, and ſince euen vntill this preſent time by his Prophetes and Apoſtles? Such and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie religions which haue beene, howe coulde it euer be found in them, as may be founde in the true Church by the holy ſcriptures howe that the ſupernaturall, he who is euerlaſtingly, that is the Lorde Iehova, who of himſelfe hath his being, and not of any others, and of him all thinges their beinges, hath by his eternall worde and ſpirite created all thinges, made and faſhioned them, and by him, not by our owne force and vertue, wee haue ſuch dignitie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb facs="tcp:19970:5"/>aboue all creatures of the earth, that we were made according to his owne image, which excellencie and our firſt perfection was loſt by our ingratitude in our firſt parentes: and that ſince that time we be and ſhall bee reſtored thereto againe in a more large perfection by the onely meanes of his onely ſonne, by which he hath made vs: and that for the manifeſtation of his ineſtimable goodneſſe and glorie, by the which he teacheth vs in his holy ſcriptures, and aſſureth vs by his ſpirite, that wee ſhall be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly taken vp to his glorie, foraſmuch as he is able to doe ſo, and will doe it. So many and ſuch ſundrie ſortes of religion as haue bene, had they euer yet ſince the beginning, of the world ſo continuall an order of good and faithfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who being inſpired with the ſpirit of god, haue conſtantly taught and mainteined againſt all the rage of the worlde the trueth of his holy doctrine, as hath the right religion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, which is the verie Chriſtianitie, done? Doth not GOD thereby and by ſundrie other meanes ſufficiently declare the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the miniſterie of his holy worde, and true religion, which he from time to time hath approued, for aſmuch as therein hee hath placed and ſet the true and pure infallible veritie, for to inſtructe and guide man euen vnto him who is the authour and creatour of all thinges.</p>
            <p>Nowe ſeeing that we haue ſuch a founder of our religion, who giueth vs alſo grace to follow the ſame: let Sathan inuent as many meanes as
<pb facs="tcp:19970:6"/>he will for to ouerthrow and extinguiſh it: Let him breath as many illuſions and inchantmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes into the mindes of men as he can, for to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that this true religion which wee hold began but of late, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhal ſoone decay againe &amp;c. It is notwithſtanding moſt euident that it hath bene euer ſince the beginning of the worlde, and that wee haue teſtimonie of him who hath eſtabliſhed the ſame, and may ſurely repoſe our confidence in him, that like as hee hath ordeined, that whileſt the ſunne &amp; Moone ſhall giue light to the earth, he will neuer faile to helpe and aſiſte his: and that finally we ſhall bee with our heade and Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And hereof we doe aſſure our ſelues, and doe feele of the ſame in our ſelues a certaintie proceeding of the ſpirite of God, that ſo it ſhall come to paſſe at the time which God hath ordained: neither is this religion that we holde falſe or wicked (as ſome yet ſay) inaſmuch as it is grounded vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pure word of God, according to the which we labour and are willing to ſerue God, without mingling therewith any thing imagined by our owne braine (like as we be ſlaundered to do) for to make a religion of our owne deuiſing. And therefore let ſuch vnderſtande that this our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had not the firſt beginning at Luther or Iohn Hus, and that it was neuer hearde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſome falſely ſay, and that it ſhall not therefore long abide. For notwithſtanding that thorough the great vngodlineſſe and euill that hath beene and yet is amongſt ſome men of the
<pb facs="tcp:19970:6"/>Church, and thorough the outrage of carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, with careleſneſſe and not regarding the glorie of God or his trueth, yea through the verie contempt and falling away from God and all trueth, the doctrin which he had publiſhed &amp; ſet forth before by his Prophetes and Apoſtles, and by his ſonne he hath ſuffered and bene wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that this true religion ſhould be by his moſt iuſt iudgement obſcured and hidden from men ſo as they might not diſcerne it according to any outwarde appearaunce, neither that it could bee redreſſed by the good doctours: yea the trueth was ſo darkened, that to the view and outward iudgement of the worldly there coulde be ſeene no tracke or ſteppe of God in the Church, and that according to worlde mens fantaſie, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that God had forſaken his Church, and giuen it vtterly to the ſpoyle, ſeeing that all was turned to ydolatrie and ſuperſtition, which God in his word ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he miſliketh &amp; moſt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorreth, yet euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had reſerued ſome in his Church, that had neuer bowed the knee before the idoll Ball, before this Antichriſt, for to conſent vnto, or beleeue his doctrine, being directly againſt the pure worde of God, as came to paſſe in the time of Elias when the confuſion and vngodlineſſe of the people was ſuch, that there was no ſemblance of the Church ſeene, in-in ſo much that this holy Prophete thought that all had beene vtterly giuen ouer vnto the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of images and to idolatrie: but he was deceiued: for God hath reſerued ſeauen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes,
<pb facs="tcp:19970:7"/>which neuer had bowed the knee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baal. And in like manner, if after the time of the primitiue Church the like alſo proued, that for the wickedneſſe and vnthankfulneſſe of the people GOD ſuffered the like confuſion and idolatrie to raigne: yet we muſte vnderſtande, that foraſmuch as God is one and the ſelfe ſame God, aſwell nowe as he was in the time of the Apoſtles, that hee hath reſerued vnto himſelfe through all ages ſeauen thouſande (yea an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number) which neuer bowed their knees before this ſtately ydoll, before this man of ſinne this ſonne of perdition, who ſitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. The faithfull, I ſay, haue not ſought for ſaluation in his doctrine: but rather forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and renouncing that, haue beene aſſured in their heart by the ſpirite of God, to obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the alone meane and merites of Ieſus Chriſt our onely ſauiour.</p>
            <p>They therefore be of a wrong opinion, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che iudge and eſteeme the Church of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fantaſie, not to haue continued alwayes. If the doctours, who were verie god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and righteous, haue not wel diſcerned the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie and true religion of his Church: and moreouer, if that this excellent Prophet, who was filled with the ſpirit of God ſo aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was ſo much deceiued when hee woulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humaine iudgement recken the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of GOD: what may wee thinke ſhal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto vs, whoſe iudgement (for the moſte parte) is altogether vnperfecte. They are alſo
<pb facs="tcp:19970:7"/>deceiued and doe fooliſhly and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly which iudge the number of the electe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacitie of their ſenſes: for God hath a meane, to him nothing difficult, but to vs vnknowne, by the which he may conſerue his elect marueilouſly, then when all ſeemeth tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpſide downe and ſpoyled. Well may the elect then be perſecuted, but neuer confounded, nor the Church extinct, inſomuch as it hath God for the founder and defendour, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect haue God the creatour of heauen and earth for their gardein and protector: like as he hath neuer fayled to helpe his at all ſeaſons with the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirite making euen ſeene and knowne to the worlde his greate loue and care towarde them throughout all ages, as hath beene euidently ſeene. Let vs not doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the trueth of him who hath promiſed to abide with vs vntill the ende of the worlde, of which his promiſe we ſee and feele daily effectes albeit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are vnworthie thereof. Thus much haue I thought good to ſpeake concerning the continuance of the true Church, whoſe founder is Chriſt. Nowe will I ſhew briefely the order of the diſcourſe following, which is this: That all the gouernement of the Church which hath beene from the beginning of the worlde vntill this preſent, is compriſed in fiue orders: the firſt this preſent, is compriſed in fiue orders: the firſt of which contayneth the firſt fathers, to wit, from Adam, who was inſtructed by the ſon of God &amp;c. The ſecond of the Patriarches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at Abraham. The third of the Prophets,
<pb facs="tcp:19970:8"/>and beginneth at Samuel. The fourth the high prieſtes and gouernours, and beginneth at Ioſue otherwiſe called Ieſus, and at the conductour Zorobabell. The fift and laſt beginneth at Iohn Baptiſt and our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and at his Apoſtles and their diſciples, Biſhops &amp; Paſtours that ſucceeded after them, and euen vnto the Biſhops whom God hath raiſed vp alſo in theſe laſt times, for the mainteinance of his Church, and for to correct the errours and abhominable traditions of men which doe infect the true and pure doctrin of God, the which he hath confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and will conſerue for euer, for the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Church. For the which alſo O Lorde I beſeech thee, that thou wilt nowe day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more ſende good and faithfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, true ſetters foorth of thy worde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out all the real mes and prouinces, to the ruine and deſtruction of the kingdome of this man of ſinne, Antichriſt: and to the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the kingdome of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our onely ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Lord Amen.</p>

            <head>A TESTIMONIE OF the true Church of God: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as wel by the doctrine as liues of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie <hi>holie men, both Patriarches and Prophets,</hi> and alſo by the Apoſtles and their true ſucceſſours.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>Here is first declared, howe that man was created in all perfection of beautie, righteouſneſſe, and puritie, and that he hath despiſed the commaundement of God, and his trueth, through the perſuaſion of ſathan, to whome he with all his poſteritie became ſeruant and ſlaue, and was ſpoyled both of his vnderſtanding and al beatitude: and therefore he had neede to be instructed, to the end he might diſcerne, and be fully aſſured of the meane of his deliuerance and perfect restauration, the which the eternall ſonne of God hath manifested vnto him, and hath vpholden perpetually his Church.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>GOD, after that he had created Heauen and Earth, and all things comprehended in them, created laſt of all man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne ſemblance and likeneſſe, that is to ſay, wholy good, pure, full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without ſinne, in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of heart, of iuſtice and vnderſtanding: and placed him with Eua his wife in earthly Paradiſe, for to liue there in a bleſſed eſtate. Then the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which might make them abide in this eſtate, was, that they ſhould in humbleneſſe ſubmit them ſelues daily before the maieſtie of God, magnifying him with giuing of thankes, and that in them ſelues they ſhould not ſéeke their owne proper glory: but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19970:10"/>conſidering that all thinges procéeded from aboue, they ſhould therefore haue their affections fixed on high, for to glorifie God alone, vnto whom al praiſe and glory is due.</p>
            <p>But immediatly after, when they had caſt the commaundement of God behinde their backes, and deſpiſed it, in eating (through the perſuaſion of the Serpent) of the fruit that was forbidden them, they loſt then the whole dignitie and excellencie of their firſt creation, &amp; were quite ſpoyled of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great glory, wherewith they were before indowed, and were made ſeruants and bondſlaues to him, who by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſleights and wiles had ſo intangled them, that he cauſed them to giue credite vnto him, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them cleane out of the way of al felicitie and trueth, and to fill them with all errours and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, that he might make them in all thinges and by all thinges like vnto him ſelfe, who in like ſort through his ingratitude had fallen from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude and goodneſſe which GOD had firſt placed in him.</p>
            <p>And thus God in the beginning hath made our firſt parents in all integritie of heart, in trueth, and righteouſneſſe, good, pure, and perfect. And the ſame diuell ſpeaking by the mouth of the ſerpent, was in the beginning pure and good. For as Moſes wrote (being inſpired with the ſpirite of God) in the firſt chapter of Geneſis, at the end of the chapter. GOD ſawe all that he had made, and behold, it was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good. And hereby we may ſée and knowe, howe that this craftineſſe and wickedneſſe in the ſerpent was not ſo created and made in him: and that the diuell of his maliciouſneſſe and ſubtiltie, vndertooke through deceits, full of lyes, to beguile and to allure vnto him. Adam and Eua, as in the end he did in déede, through the iuſt iudgement of God. And that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19970:10"/>bicauſe they cleaued not faſt to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of God, but rather were willing to ſticke vnto the perſuaſion and counſel of ſathan, who, for bicauſe he might put the ſame in effect, had power to make the ſerpent ſpeake, one of the moſt craftieſt beaſtes in the fieldes: not that he was ſuch by his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but made ſuch through the inſtigation of ſathan: who not only had for that preſent time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at the handes of God, ſo to frame his words in the mouth of this beaſt, but afterward vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other brute beaſts, as the prophane hiſtories do beare witneſſe of ſuch as haue ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon we haue to conſider, that the diuell ſéeketh from time to time, by al meanes that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can, for to beguile men, and to make them giue credit vnto lyes, wherein he taketh great pleaſure, dimming al the eyes of their vnderſtanding by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine priuie and ſecrete meanes, that he may kéepe them ſtill vnder his ſubiection and thraldome. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde here from whence do come ſo many falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, ſo many vntrue and wicked thoughtes, ful of leaſings, wherevnto men do more leane, then to the truth of God. Marke here the chiefeſt fountaine of all diſorders and woes, which euer happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: marke the way which our forefathers tooke, by which they fell from that high degrée of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, of peace, of reſt, and of ioy: wherevnto they were firſt appointed by God, and by what meanes they with al their poſteritie are falen, and are tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled headlongs into this great diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which we vntill this day ſée our ſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, in as much as we followe after them the ſame counſell that they did.</p>
            <p>Therefore, for as much as we knowe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or firſt originall of the maladie, why ſhould we not labour to cure the ſame by contrarie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19970:11"/>ſéeing that wickedneſſe hath begunne to take roote, we muſt followe the counſel and will of God, and not regard the perſuaſions of ſathan, but let vs forſake him with all his counſels and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and let vs go with prayers, faſtings, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intreatings, to require at the handes of God, for his counſel, and that he would inſtruct vs according to his will, and that we may followe the ſame. And we may thus aſſure our ſelues, that we ſhall féele a wonderfull vnderſtanding of the trueth of God, &amp; of his good will, which he hath declared in the doctrine of his holy Prophetes and Apoſtles, of whome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than would that we ſhould haue no knowledge, but rather that their memorie ſhould be wholy extinguiſhed, for as much as he ſéeth that in them is declared the way of equitie, the mediatour by whome we haue deliuerance out of the gulfe of all horrour and euill made manifeſt. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel nowe ſéeing him ſelfe to be depriued of this excellent glory of God, which ſhined very clearely in him at the beginning of his creation: he in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath aſſayed from our firſt parents, to depriue vs eternally of this excellent glory and felicitie: wherevnto he ſéeth no meanes offered him by God, howe he may be any more reſtored.</p>
            <p>But God, who had created mankinde, to the end he might be glorified thereby, was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeme him againe, although he was ſo alienated from him, he would not ſo confound, deſtroy, ſpoyle, and throwe him downe to hell, nor giue him ſo ouer wholy to the diuell, for to let him deale with him as him luſted: but through his moſt great goodneſſe, mercy, and grace, he hath ſuſtained and vpholden Adam and Eua, ſhewing vnto them, that he who is the enimie vnto all truth, iuſtice, and true felicitie, they ſhall haue once in their powers to bruſe his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19970:11"/>head, albeit that in the mean time by his iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſuffered and was willing that he ſhould ſting and afflict them with diuers aſſaultes.</p>
            <p>Nowe, to the intent that Adam and Eua, ſhould be aſſured of their reſtauration, euen in like ſort as GOD by his diuine word and ſpirite, had created, made, and faſhioned all things in their being: ſo alſo by the ſame word God hath decréed, that the ſéede of the woman ſhould breake the head of the ſerpent, and by conſequence, ſhuld be deliuered vtterly from all his thraldome.</p>
            <p>This word then being almightie, ſubſiſting in the eſſence of GOD from all eternitie, by which the worlde and all things had bene made, called vnto repentance Adam and Eua, giuing them time and leaſure to returne, &amp; to reforme them ſelues againe vnto the obedience from which they had erred.</p>
            <p>And thereby may we clearely vnderſtand, that it hath from the beginning of the world, inſtructed and taught Adam. For this word, the ſonne of GOD, which reproued Adam for his fault and offence, and which declared, that the ſtrength &amp; force that was in the ſerpent, ſhould be broken: hath alſo taught and rebuked him for his miſdoing, letting him well vnderſtand how abhominable a thing ſinne is, and howe many miſchiefes it cauſeth, the death and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting participation in al ignominie and ſhame with this wicked &amp; craftie wretch, that had brought him into ſuch ſlauerie vnto him ſelfe: &amp; that through him ſelfe or any other creature, a full deliuerance from this ſubiection or perfect ſatiſfaction, for the abhominable ſinne that he had committed againſt God, could not be made, but by the onely meanes of this promiſe: by which alone Adam and Eua had knowledge that they were fréely pardoned, without any mediation of their owne workes or merites.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19970:12"/>And in all theſe thinges had they ſome ſight and knowledge of, by the inſpiration of the ſame ſpirite of him whoſe voyce they vnderſtoode: who, for as much as he would teach them, knewe alſo very wel, that all ſhould be ſaid in vaine, if they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with this ſpirite of knowledge and beléeuing. And thus this eternall word, the ſonne of GOD, hath from the beginning taught the firſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam.</p>
            <p>Whereby we muſt marke, that God hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually aſſiſted, and doth aſſiſt his Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth it, and maintayneth it, and gouerneth it, as is euidently to be proued: and manifeſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence declareth, that the Church and his doctrine could not haue had power to continue ſo long time againſt ſuch horrible aſſaultes of ſathan, of tyrants, and of wicked men, if the Church had not had theſe guarders and defenders. Which alwayes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Fathers and Patriarches, Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob: which Iacob being gouernour of the Church of GOD in his time, hath made plaine demonſtration of the true Meſſias (ſo many times afore promiſed) to be his guarder. And therefore he ſaith in the <hi>48.</hi> of Geneſis, in the <hi>16.</hi> verſe. The Angel that hath guarded me from all euill, bleſſe theſe children. Thus we may ſée in this place and in many others, how he calleth the Meſſias (that is to ſay, the ſonne of God) Angel, calling him his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or kéeper, attributing vnto him the power and authoritie for to be able to bleſſe him. That which he vnderſtoode only of an Angel, he hath not ſo fully ſpoken, being as it were plucked back with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, bicauſe he had attributed that vnto an Angel, which was due vnto God, vnto whom alone Iacob continually aſcribed all power, bleſſing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, as vnto God alone it doth belong.</p>
            <p>And in like ſort, Eſaie being moued by the ſame
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19970:12"/>ſpirite that Iacob was, ſaid in the <hi>63.</hi> chapter, verſe <hi>9.</hi> The Angel of his face hath ſaued them, the ſame hath redéemed them, through his loue and mercy hath holden them vp, and exalted them continually.</p>
            <p>Alſo, for to giue likewiſe to vnderſtand, that in this diuine eſſence the holy ſpirite is reſident, &amp; that he wil alwayes thereby aſſiſt his Church, in the <hi>59.</hi> chapter, verſe <hi>21.</hi> he ſaith. Behold mine aliance with them, ſaith the Lord. My ſpirite which is in thée, and my wordes that I haue put in thy mouth, ſhall not ſlide out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſéede for euer. And infinite places be there, where is giuen to vnderſtand, that God hath always aſſiſted his Church, as wel by his holy ſpirit, as alſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all fauour, comfort, and bleſſing, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, through whom he had made all things, whome he had promiſed to ſend at his appointed time, to the end that by him he might purchaſe vnto him ſelfe a holy people, being by him ſanctified, which ſhould be cloathed with his holineſſe, as he promiſed that all ſuch ſhall be as do beléeue and put their truſt in him, and that they ſhall remaine ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally through him.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe alſo, bicauſe it is not in our facultie and power to beléeue: he promiſed and doth promiſe (as hath bene afore declared in Eſaye) the aſſiſtance of his ſpirite, without which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of the word is vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>And thus we muſt vnderſtand, that all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Patriarches haue infallibly knowne and beléeued: who were inſtructed through viſions or Oracles, and alſo were ſomwhat taught from hand to hande, as were conſequently the true faithfull people their ſucceſſors, hauing had (by the operation of Gods ſpirit) unprinted in their hearts ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of doctrine: Neither is it to be doubted, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19970:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>that God hath alwayes ratified this holy inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the which for that it might the better continue in ſtrength from age to age, &amp; for to helpe better the memory of men, he hath willed to be put in writing by Moſes, who was for to write theſe matters cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; elected, and that he ſhuld ſet them foorth before their eyes, like as he had vnderſtood and truely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen through the ſpirite of God, who created man in ſuch puritie, and when man had ſinned, called him to repentance, by this ſame word, by which he had made him, promiſing and aſſuring him of ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his ſinne. And for this cauſe the auncient Doctours ſaide, that the ſonne of God is called the word, for as much as it hath ſpoken to the Fathers. Beholde what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in his booke againſt the Iewes, in the firſt chapter. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Cain: where is Abel thy brother? And <hi>Iraeneus</hi> writing againſt hereſies in the <hi>14.</hi> chapter, ſaith: The ſonne from the beginning, aſſiſting and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his handie worke, maketh manifeſt the father to all them that he will, and when he will, and how he will.</p>
            <p>To conclude, we ſée howe that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, God by his ſonne and ſpirit, was made knowne to the firſt man, giuing him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his good will, the which he made more and more to vnderſtand and knowe thereof to all them of his Church, of the which Church enſued the chiefe and principall Doctours.</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>And for to goe on further in ſpeaking of Waldo, of whom the Waldenſes tooke their name.</p>
               <p>He in the ſame time made a collection in his vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tongue of the places of the auncient fathers: for to defende his adherents, not onely by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holy ſcriptures: but alſo by teſtimonie of the doctours, againſt the aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>It is verie likely by the hiſtorians, yea by the writings of the aduerſaries, that this aſſemblie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a certeine time (as about the ſpace of foure or fiue yeares) that Waldo taught in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cytie of Lyons before that he was put to exile and baniſhment: for inaſmuch as he was mightie and had friends, he was not ſo ſone entrapped with daungers, as after ward they were: and thus the name of the poore in Lyons began to bee a byworde, they were called Waldenſes, Lyonniſtes, Inſabbati, that is to ſay, ſuch as obſerue no ſabbothes nor feaſtes, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch names were deuiſed againſt them, for to make them ſeeme deteſtable.</p>

               <p>After that Waldo and his adherents were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of Lyons, ſome of them went backe into Lombardie, whereas they multiplyed: ſo that their doctrine began to bee ſpreade thorough Italy, and came to Sicilia: as the patents of Frederike the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde,

               <p>By the recytal of thoſe that haue writen againſt them, and of Reinerius, who lyued &amp; wrote ſhortly after that time, it may bee gathered that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was this:</p>

               <p>That there is but one onely mediatour: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they not ought to call vpon ſaincts.</p>
               <p>That there is no purgatorie: but that all men that are iuſtified thorough Chriſt, goe vnto eternall life. That there is no thirde nor fourth place.</p>
               <p>They receiue and allowe two ſacraments only, Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper.</p>
               <p>They ſay that all maſſes, and eſpecially thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented for treſpaſſes, bee damnable, and that they ought to be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>That all humaine traditions muſt bee reiected, and not be accounted any thing neceſſarie to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That ſingings and rehearſing of offices, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings tyed vnto a certein day, ſuperfluitie of feaſts, difference of meates, ſo many degrées and orders of prieſtes, Monckes and Nonnes: ſo many bleſſings, and conſecrating of creatures, vowes, pilgrimages and all the confuſion and great heape of ceremonies inuented heretofore, ought to be abolyſhed.</p>
               <p>They deny the prymacie of the Pope, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the power that they vſurpe ouer cyuill polly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And they allowe none other degrées ſaue of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops miniſters and Deacons.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19970:56"/>that the Pope is at this preſent the fountaine of all euils.</p>
               <p>That the marriage of miniſters is good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in the Church.</p>
               <p>That thoſe that heare the word of God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande it aright, be the true Church: vnto whom Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen the Keyes for to let in the ſhéepe, and to driue away the Wolues.</p>
               <p>Lo here is briefely the doctrine of the Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the which the enemies of the puritie of the holy ſcriptures, haue impugned againſt, &amp; for the which (by their owne teſtimonie) they haue béene perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>Mathias Illiricus in the Catalogue that he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of the witneſſes of the trueth, ſpeaketh of the conſultations of certeine aduocats of Auignon. Alſo of the thrée Archbiſhops of Narbonna, of Arles, and of Aix, and likwiſe of the Biſhop of Albanie, about the rooting out of the Waldenſes: written thrée yeares paſt: by which it appeareth, that at that time and before were a great nomber of the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed here and there throughout all Fraunce.</p>
               <p>It may alſo be gathered by the conſultations of the ſaide thrée Archbiſhoppes, that as the number was great, the perſecution alſo was very cruel: for in the ende of them it is founde thus written. Who is ſo young in Fraunce, that hee knoweth not the condemnation of the heretikes called Waldenſes, executed of long time ſo iuſtly? A thing ſo famous, and ſo manifeſt, which at ſo great coſtes and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Catholikes was ſealed with ſo many condemnations, and the deathes of thoſe wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, can it bee called in doubt?</p>
               <p>It appeareth then what bouchery was vſed at that time with the faithfull, what crueltie the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts of antichriſt exerciſed then againſt the good
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19970:57"/>which were willing to mainteine the puritie of the holy &amp; true ſeruice of God, like as by his holy word he teacheth vs that he woulde be adored, ſerued and honoured.</p>
               <p>I will alſo recite ſome thing of that which is written of Albigeois or Albois, a people that had receiued a beginning of the light of the trueth, and ſtoode in contention againſt the Idolatrie of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: which thing firſt cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre from the Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>They inhabited the countrie about Tholouſe &amp; Albi. S. Dominick, author of that newe ſecte, that call themſelues preachers, came out of Spaine and perſecuted them greatly both in worde and déede.</p>
               <p>Pope Innocent the thirde ſent alſo in that time vnto them a legate, Nicholas biſhop of Thuſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, who comming thither with foure horſes &amp; two mules, returned in ſhort ſpace with fiftie and with great pillage which hee brought thence, hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed great crueltie and tyrannie againſt theſe poore people, whom alſo hee charged with horrible crymes, thereby to make them odious to all the worlde.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Pope cauſed to be publiſhed a croiſard againſt them, and gaue ful indulgence and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes vnto thoſe that woulde make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Simon Earle of Mountforde went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and deſtroyed a great multitude of them neare Tholous, a hundreth and fortie were burned in the dioceſe of Narbonna, and <hi>4.</hi> hundreds in the dioceſe of Tholous, at ſundrie times.</p>

               <p>Then for to appeaſe this tumult, there were ſixe appoynted out of the ſchole, who were at that time the moſt famous in al the vniuerſity, amongſt whom was <hi>Guil. de ſanct Amour,</hi> for to ſende vnto Rome to the Pope, and to ſhewe the inſolencie and blaſphemy of the monkes.</p>
               <p>The monks ſent alſo on their partes: and after great contention, their errours touching their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Goſpell was condemned.

               <p>Theſe bee the very wordes of Matthew Paris who was in the ſame time.</p>

               <p>Alſo that the Pope ſtandeth in contention againſt Ieſus Chriſt: For in ſteade that hee commaunded to pay tribute vnto kinges for himſelfe and for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: he contrarie to his will whoſe vicar he ſayth he is, hath neglected kingdomes and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the worlde, laboureth to bring vnder his ſubiection kinges and princes, vnder title of hys ſtyle.</p>
               <p>That he taketh away from the Church al what
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19970:61"/>ſoeuer him luſteth: and notwithſtanding he is not content to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenth part of the lands therof, but he will haue the firſt fruites of the benefits at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters handes: to the intent that aſwell for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as for thoſe that be of his bloude, he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a newe patrimonie of the good willes of fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Alſo that he enioyeth his lakeyes, whome he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into Englande that they ſhall bring not onely the liuinges and rayment of the Church, but alſo that they ſhall teare their ſkinnes and fleſhe like dogges.</p>
               <p>Alſo that the Pope may bee iuſtly compared to Nabuchodonoſor, who deſtroyed the temple, and robbed it of the veſſels of gold. For looke as hethen dealt, euen ſo doth he alſo. He afore named ſpoyled the miniſters of the houſe of GOD, and depriued them of that which was neceſſarie for the ſeruice: this doth euen as much.</p>
               <p>That there is no ſorrowe like vnto that that is in the Church. For already becauſe of the great do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour thereof, and for the teares that it hath ſpread, the face is become more blacke then coales, ſo as in ſome places it is no more knowen.</p>
               <p>That the Pope who ſaith, that he is the father of the Church hath brought it into dreadful darkenes, and that he hath made it dronken with wormwood and gall.</p>
               <p>After this the ſaide Caſſiodorus made an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie vnto God, and ſaide, O Lorde looke vppon the affliction of thy people, and heare their mourning, and come downe: for the heart of this man is more hardened then was the hart of Pharao, who would not ſuffer the people to depart in libertie, but onely by thy power.</p>
               <p>Alſo that the ſaide Pope doth afflicte, not onlye
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19970:62"/>on earth: but alſo after death: for that after death he deuoureth the goods of all Chriſtians generally, vnder colour that they be deceaſed without making teſtament.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that the conſpiracie of this man ſhall bee cauſe of a newe enemie againſt Englande, and that becauſe by his meanes the treaſures doe decreaſe.</p>
               <p>That it is expedient for the health of the church, leaſt it ſhoulde fall into a further miſerie, that the king and nobilitie of the realme, who haue beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed verie liberally vppon the Church, would be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to maintaine the Church, and to withſtand, the coniurations &amp; conſpiracies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pride and arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eie of this man, who hath no regard vnto God: but for the thinges aforeſaide, and for to enrich himſelfe and his kinſefolke, and for his neaſt, labouring to ſet it vp as high as the Egle, by ſuch and other like coſening trickes he heapeth vp by a newe domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all the money of England.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that the ſimplicitie of the world diſſembling in this place is no cauſe of the ruine of the Church and of the Realme, and that there is no great reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die added.</p>
               <p>That God taketh away the vaile from the heart of this man, and giueth him an humble and contrit heart, and maketh him to knowe his true pathes, by which this man retyreth out of darkeneſſe, and endeuoureth to leaue off his wicked labours. And that the vine which the right hande of GOD hath planted ſhal be filled with good braunches.</p>
               <p>That he ought to take héede vnto the worde of God and to the Prophetie of Ieremie chap. <hi>22.</hi> for to withſtande ſuch interpriſes, who ſaith thus, Thou O paſtour which haſt diſperſed my people, and haſt caſt them out of their habitations, behold I wil viſit vpon thée, the malyce of thy enterpriſes and there
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19970:62"/>ſhall not be a man of thy ſéede which ſhall ſit vppon the ſeat of Dauid, nor ſhall haue any more power in Iuda: ſo that thy neſt ſhal be a deſert, and ruinous as Sodome and Gomorra.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that if it happen he be not dreaded by theſe words, nor leaue off from his enterpriſes, nor make reſtitution of that which he hath taken, that they finge for him, that is ſo wickedly hardened, the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and eight Pſalme. As for vs wee will ſinge dayly prayſes openly through Ieſus Chriſt, to him vnto whome all thinges do obey.</p>
               <p>For to ſée the courſe thereof more narrowely worde for word, looke the ſaide Epiſtle, the whiche hath beene writen out, tranſtated out of an old booke founde in Englande in the Church of S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban. He that woulde ſée it perfectly, let him reade the liues of the Biſhoppes and Popes of Rome, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the great Catalogue of the writinges of England, ſet forth by Iohn Bale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>131</hi> In the yeare <hi>1314.</hi> or thereaboutes, there was a man named Dulcin of Nauarre, who bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the vices of Churchmen, and was executed with his wife. Thoſe that bee called Dulcins tooke their name of this Dulcin. Naucl. They ſaide that the authority which Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen to the Church was expyred becauſe of the wickedneſſe of the Prelates: and that the Church of Rome was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, becauſe it was become a whore.</p>
               <p>Alſo that they were the Church, and followed the rule of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>That al the prelates ſince Pope Sylueſter haue bene preuaricatours, becauſe they lyued not in true humilitie, and that therfore they ought to haue no tythes payed them.</p>
               <p>Many of the adherents of Dulcin were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>144.</hi> perſons dwelling in the mountaynes of

                  <hi>132</hi> In the ſame time, to wit, <hi>1315.</hi> and in the raigne of the Emperour Henry the ſeuenth of that name, was a good and faithfull man <hi>Arnoldus de villa noua,</hi> an expert Phiſition and an excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematitian. Some ſay that hee was of Chalons, others of Narbonna. He was at that time iudged an heretike, becauſe he ſaide that ſathan had cauſed all Chriſtian people to erre out of the right way.</p>
               <p>That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of Chriſtians then was none other but ſuch a faith as deuils had.</p>
               <p>That thoſe which bee in the cloyſters be out of charitie, and doe condemne themſelues in falſifying the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, and leading Chriſtians vnto hell.</p>
               <p>That the diuines haue maliciouſly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled the ſonges of Philoſophers with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>That in the ſacrifice of the altar the Prieſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing vnto God, and that maſſes do neither profite the lyuing nor the deade.</p>
               <p>He proued by Daniel and by Sybilla Erithrea, that Antichriſt in full tyrannie did perſecute the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in his bookes which hee made of medicine, hee wrote againſt the Iacopins, that it was lawfull to eate fleſhe: A cutting ſworde againſt the Thomiſtes: an admonition of Ieſus Chriſt vnto the Chriſtians: Of the craftineſſe of falſe Prophets: Of miſerie of the Cymbals of the Church: Of the conſummation of the world, &amp; other bookes.</p>
               <p>He was iudged an heretyke by the Iacopins of Tarracon. Laſtly being ſent vnto the Pope by Fredericke king of Sicilia, he dyed in the way, and was buried at Genes, being a true champion of our

               <p>In the yeare <hi>1328.</hi> or there abouts, Pope Iohn the <hi>23.</hi> wrote vnto the gréekes that there was but one onely Church, ouer which he was the head and vicar of Ieſus Chriſt. To whom the Gréekes aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in fewe wordes thus: We doe verely beleue that thy power is very great ouer thy ſubiectes: we cannot abide thy extreame pride, nor ſatiſfie thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, The deuill be with thée: for GOD is with vs.</p>

                  <hi>Marſilius Patauinus</hi> compiled and exhibited vnto the Emperour Ludouike, a worthy worke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Defenſor Pacis:</hi> written in the Emperours behalfe againſt the Pope. Wherin (both Godly and learnedly diſputing againſt the Pope) he proueth al biſhops and Prieſts to be equal: and that the Pope hath no ſuperioritie aboue other Biſhoppes, much leſſe aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour. That the worde of God ought to be onely the chiefe iudge in deciding and determining cauſes eccleſiaſticall. That not onely ſpirituall perſons but lay men alſo being Godly &amp; learned, ought to be admitted into generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. That the Clergie and the Pope ought to be ſubiect vnto magiſtrates. That the Church is the vniuerſitie of the faithfull, and that the foundation and heade of the Church is Chriſt, and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer appointed any vicar or Pope ouer his vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church: That Biſhops ought to be choſen eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one by their owne Church and Clergie: that the marriage of prieſtes may lawfully bee permitted: That S. Peter was neuer at Rome: That the Cleargie and Synagoge of the Pope is a denne of théeues: That the doctrine of the Pope is not to be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19970:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>followed, becauſe it leadeth to eternall deſtruction: And the corrupte manners of the Chriſtians doe ſpring and flow out of the wickednes of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp;c. he diſputeth moreouer in an other worke of frée iuſtification by grace: and extenuateth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, ſaying that they are no efficient cauſes of our ſaluation, but onely <hi>fine qua non,</hi> that is to ſay, that workes be no cauſe of our iuſtification, but yet our iuſtification goeth not without them, for which his doctrine moſt ſounde and Catholicke, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Pope.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iacobus Miſnenſis,</hi> who wrote of the comming of Antichriſt. In the ſame hee maketh mention of a certeine learned man, whoſe name was Militzius (ſaith he) which was a famous and worthy prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in Perga. He lyued about the yeare <hi>1366.</hi> long before Hus, &amp; before Wicklieffe alſo. In the ſame his writing hee declareth, howe the ſame good man Militzius was conſtrayned by the ſpirite of God to goe to Rome, and there publikely to preach, &amp; that afterwarde before the inquiſitour he affirmed the ſame. That the ſame mightie and great Antichriſt, the which the ſcriptures make mention of, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie come.</p>
               <p>He affirmed alſo that the Church by their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhoulde become deſolate: and that iniquitie ſhoulde abound, that is by reaſon of Mammon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of iniquitie. Alſo he ſaide that there were in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19970:64"/>Church of Chriſt Idols, which ſhoulde deſtroy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and make the Temple deſolate, but were cloaked by hypocriſie: further that there bee many which denie Chriſt, for that they kéepe ſilence: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they heare Chriſt, whome all the worlde ſhoulde know, and ſhould confeſſe his veritie before men, which alſo wittingly doe detaine the veritie and Iuſtice of God. Hee taught openly, that in the Pope, Cardinals, Biſhops, Prelates, Prieſtes, and other religious men was no trueth, but that onely he, and ſuch as held with him, taught the true way of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Mathias Pariſienſis a Bohemian borne, who about the yeare of our Lorde <hi>1370.</hi> wrote a large booke of Antichriſt, and proueth him already come, and noteth the Pope to be the ſame. In this booke he doth greatly eniue againſte the wickedneſſe of the cleargie, and againſt the neglecting of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in gouerning the Church. The Locuſtes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Apocalyps, hee ſaith be the hypocrites raigning in the Church. The workes of Antichriſt he ſaith be theſe, the fables and inuentions of men raigning in the Church, the Images and fayned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques that are worſhipped euery where.</p>
               <p>Item, that men doe worſhip euery one his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſainct and ſauiour beſide Chriſt, ſo that euery man and citie almoſt hath his diuers and peculiar Chriſt. He taught and affirmed moreouer, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe and true worſhip of God are not bounde to place, perſons or times, to bee hearde more in this place, then in an other, at this time more then at an other, &amp;c. Hee was greatly and much offended with monks and friers, for neglecting or rather burying the worde of Chriſt, and in ſtéed thereof, for celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſetting vp their owne rules and Canons, affirming it to be much hurtfull to true Godlineſſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19970:65"/>for that Prieſtes, Monkes, and Nunnes do account themſelues onely ſpirituall, and all other to be lay and ſecular, attributing onely to themſelues the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of holyneſſe, and contemning all other men, with all their politicke adminiſtration and office, as prophane in compariſon of their owne. He further writeth that Antichriſt hath ſeduced al vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities and Colleges of learned men, ſo that they teach no ſincere doctrine, neither giue any light to the Chriſtians with their teaching. Finally he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth that it will come to paſſe, that God yet once againe will raiſe vp godly teachers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feruent in the ſpirite and zeale of Helias, ſhall diſcloſe and refute the errours of Antichriſt, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſayings and writings of the vniuerſitie of Paris, alſo the writings of <hi>Guliel. de ſanct.

                  <hi>Henricus de Haſſia,</hi> an excellent learned and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man. He wrote an Epiſtle vnto <hi>Iacobus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſienſis</hi> Biſhop of Normacia, inſerted in his booke de erroribus Chriſtianorum. In the ſame Epiſtle, the authour doth greatly accuſe the ſpirituall men of euery order, yea the moſt holieſt of all other, the Pope himſelfe, of many and great vices. Hee ſaide that the Eccleſiaſticall gouernours in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church were compared to the Sunne ſhining in the day time, and the politicall gouernours, to the Moone ſhyning in the night. But the ſpirituall men he ſaid, that nowe are, doe neither ſhine in the day time, nor yet in the night time, but rather with their darkeneſſe doe obſcure both day &amp; night, that is: with their filthy liuing, ignoraunce, &amp; impietie. Hee citeth alſo out of the propheſie of Hildegardis theſe words: Therefore doth the deuill in himſelfe ſpeake of you Prieſts: daintie bankets and feaſts, wherein is all voluptuouſnes, doe I finde amongſt theſe men: In ſo much that mine eyes, mine eares,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:19970:65"/>my belly, my vaynes, bee euen filled with the froth of them, and my breſtes ſtande aſtrout with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of them, &amp;c. Laſtly ſaith he, they euery day more and more, as lucyfer doe ſéeke to clymbe higher and higher, till that euery day with him more and more they fall déeper and déeper. Hee liued Anno. <hi>1371.</hi>

               <p>Nilus was Archbiſhop of Theſſolonica, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>1380.</hi> He wrote a long worke againſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, that is againſt ſuch as tooke part &amp; helde with the Churche of Rome. His booke firſt being written in Gréek, was after tranſlated into Latin and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nowe into Engliſh, in this our time. In the firſt Chap. of his booke, he layeth all the blame and fault of the diſcention and ſchiſme betwene the Eaſt and the Weſt Church vppon the Pope. Hee affirmed that the Pope onely woulde commaunde what him luſted, were it neuer ſo contrarie to all the olde and auncient Cannons. That hee would heare and followe no mans aduiſe: that hee would not permit any free Councels to be aſſembled &amp;c. In the ſecond Chapt. of his booke hee purpoſedly maketh a verie learned diſputation: for firſt he declareth that he had no whit at all by Gods commaundement, but onely by humaine Lawe any dignitie, more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Biſhops: which dignitie, the Councels, the fathers, and Emperours haue graunted vnto him: neither did they graunt the ſame for any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration more, or greater ordinaunce, then for that the ſame citie then had the Empery of all the whole world: and not at al for that that Peter was there, or not there. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>133</hi> In the yeare <hi>1383.</hi> Iohn wikliefe liued in England, who hauing of long time made profeſſion of diuinitie at Oxenforde a citte and vniuerſitie in Englande, and hee ſéeing that true diuinitie was
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19970:66"/>vilely corrupted with much filthineſſe of queſtions and inuentions ſet forth by the Pope, he coulde not but lament in his hearte, and determined to remedy ſuch a diſorder.</p>
               <p>He ſawe well that hee coulde not without great trouble remoue away abuſes, and that thoſe that had ſo long time growen in the hearts of men could not eaſilie be rooted out on a ſodaine. And therefore he thought good to deale there with by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
               <p>Firſt he made this aſſaye againſt the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the trueth, that is, he diſputed againſt them of ſmall matters, that by that meane he might open an entrie to great things: and amongeſt other hee had to deale with a certain monke named Iohn ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyngham.</p>
               <p>Of theſe ſmall beginnings they came to higher matters. Hee at the laſt diſputed concerninge the ſacrament of the ſupper. Therein this good man had great reſiſtaunce, affirming openlye in ſcholes, that his principall intent was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way idolatrie that raigned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church concerning this matter.</p>
               <p>But marke what miſchiefe happened: a man coulde not ſo ſoone touth this wounde, without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing great ſorrowe to the worlde. The monkes and eſpecially the begging fort were in a furie: the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops would haue knowledge of this matter.</p>
               <p>He alleaged the authoritie of the auncient Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Church, in thoſe poyntes wherein they agréed with the holy ſcriptures, declaring that there is no trueth but that which is contayned in them.</p>
               <p>As for the decretiſtes he vtterly reiected them.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:19970:66"/>
               <p>He ſtedfaſtly mainteined that in the ſacrament of the ſupper the accidents be not without the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: that is to ſay, that the whiteneſſe and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the breade be not without the bread: to wit, that contrary to tranſubſtantion (which the prieſts haue forged) the breade abideth bread, and the wine contynueth in the proper ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the concluſions propoſed by him at the towne of Lambeth be theſe: If that any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Lordes, or any others haue made any donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto the myniſters of the Church, there is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſecreate condition: to wit, that God ſhoulde be honoured, and that the faithfull ſhould be edified.</p>
               <p>And if this condition ceaſſe, then they may take away from wicked paſtours that which they had giuen them, any excommunication or other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer to the contrary notwithſtanding. That if theſe dealinges of men were let alone, the cleargie which were of couetous perſons will bring all the world into their hands.</p>
               <p>Alſo that the Pope may lawfully be reproued by thoſe whom he kéepeth in obedience vnder him, and that for the vtilitie of the Church he may be accuſed both of the clearks and lay people.</p>
               <p>That the Pope as great a Lord as he reporteth himſelfe to be, muſt thinke that he is a brother vnto others, and that if he ſinne he ought to be brotherly corrected, and heare corrections brotherly. And when as by the holy ſcripture his hereſie or errour is ſhewed him he ought not to be obſtinate.</p>
               <p>And by many other concluſions he ſhewed eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the abuſe of the Pope and of the cleargy, and how that their poſſeſſions of ſo great reuenewes be vniuſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he was aſſaulted by many and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt others, the begging monkes who roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>Within a while after he was called again from baniſhment, and returned vnto the parriſhe of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he was paſtour, and there, like a luſtie champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lorde, he aboade alwayes conſtant euen vntill the death, &amp; he died in the yeare of our Lorde <hi>1388.</hi> fortie and one yeares after his death he was digged vp againe by the commandement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, and his bones were burned, and the aſhes thereof caſt into the water: but Ieſus Chriſt dieth not in his faithful ones, vſe the tyrants what cruelty they can.</p>

               <p>William Thorpe an Engliſhman was alſo a valiant martyre of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He ſuſtayned great aſſaultes of many prelats of of the Church of Rome, without forſaking his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which was to inſtruct the people according to the pure word of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore he woulde not agrée to preach the ſuperſtitions and humaine inuentions, which he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared to be contrarie to the inſtitution of the holy ſcriptures, he was condemned hauing yeelded a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of his faith.</p>
               <p>Nowe of many pointes well worth the noting, vpon the interrogations propounded to him, I will recite (for to auoyde great prolixitie) one onely: that is, that he being demaunded of the Archbiſhop of Canterburie, primate of Englande, and Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour of the whole Realme, what the Church did ſignifie, he anſwered, that it is Ieſus Chriſte and the companie of ſaincts. Which thing the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop confeſſed to be true in reſpect of heauen: but he demaunded further, what the Church was here below on earth. It is deuided into two partes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſaid Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Thorp, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two parts, which is the better, hath obtained victorie ouer the enemies, and triumpheth nowe with Chriſte in great ioy: the other part fighteth here ſtill on earth by the ſworde of faith, againſt the continuall bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes of Sathan, of the fleſhe and of the worlde. There is no ſtrength ſo violent, no pompe ſo proud, no fire of afflictions and perſecutions ſo burning, no tyrannie ſo cruel, no reaſons of Doctours ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, nor opinions ſo diuerſe which can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe them from the right rule of faith, and of the holy ſcriptures. For they be fortyfied by the worde of God in Chriſt, and firmely ſtabliſhed as vppon a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19970:68"/>ſure rocke that can not be remoued. Looke Iohn Creſpin in his booke of martyrs.</p>
               <p>Within a while after the death of Iohn Wiclief there aroſe greate perſecution in Englande againſt the faithfull for the truth of the Goſpell, which then began to take déepe rooting. The worthieſt men in the Realme were not then ſpared: the lord Cobham a knight of the order &amp; one of the peeres of England was there apprehended: but he was executed after theſe that we nowe ſpeake off. And therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of time, we will hereafter ſpeake of him more at large: for he was an excellent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>King Henrie then by publike ordinaunce made an edicte: and ſet foorth through the perſuaſions of the biſhoppes and prelates terrible puniſhmentes for all them that ſhould follow the doctrine of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliefe, vſing ſo great ſeueritie againſt them, that he helde them not onely for heretikes, but alſo as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of treaſon.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe it was ordeined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be puniſhed with two ſortes of puniſhmentes, that is, that they ſhould be both hanged and burned, and there was neither fréedome, nor any priuiledge, whereby they coulde enioye profite: ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly were they bente againſte the faithfull, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all meanes againſte them, and in that time they called al them Wicleffians who read the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the vulgar tongue, and which made their aſſemblies in ſecrete places, in the darke, preaching in woodes and buſhes.</p>
               <p>Then the Biſhops being armed with this edicte of the king, exerciſed great tyrannie againſt manie good people, and many poore innocentes: and amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt other againſt Roger Acton a knight of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a true nobleman, adorned with great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19970:68"/>he abhorred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked traditions of the Pope, had his affections withdrawen from him, and from all his aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p>For that cauſe it is reported, that he was hated amongeſt the prelats, and became odious: ſo as they could in no wiſe abide him.</p>
               <p>Finally this ſeignieur Acton was taken &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſaide edict of the kinge, and hanged, and burned.</p>
               <p>There was executed alſo with him a gentleman one M. Browne. And M. Iohn Beuerlai a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and preacher of the word of God. And that was in the yeare. <hi>1413.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Iohn Maior witneſſeth in his Scottiſh hiſtorie lib. <hi>6.</hi> chap. <hi>9.</hi> that about this time many others to the number of <hi>36,</hi> and all of a noble ſtocke, were condemned as heretikes by the biſhop &amp; were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to that cruell edict. This was in the very ſame yeare.</p>
               <p>There were alſo two others, of whome Fabius in his Chronicles ſpeaketh, to wit, Iohn Claydon cordwayner, and Richard Turmin Baker: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo according to the ſeueritie of the ordinance, were condemned and put to death.</p>
               <p>To conclude we ſée that there is neither eſtate, neither order, nor condition, whereof God is not ſkilfull enough to drawe ſome for to ſtande in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and to crie out againſt the ſuperſtitions &amp; falſe traditions of prelates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>135</hi> In the yeare <hi>1405.</hi> or thereabout, the Lord raiſed vp Iohn Hus of Bohemia, who hauing ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in the vniuerſitie of Oxeforde in England, and hauing reade certeine bookes of Wicklief, beganne to publiſhe that which hee had receiued concerning the trueth in a Temple of the Bohemians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was choſen for the preacher, and Preached
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19970:69"/>both of feſtiuall dayes and holy dayes.</p>
               <p>There he commended the doctrine of Wicklief vnto the people.</p>
               <p>In the ende the Bohemians being inſtructed with this doctrine, beganne to iudge of the Pope as he deſerued, not eſtéeming him the moſt excellent any longer, nor of any higher degree then other bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: and therevpon they went about to reforme their doctrine by concluſions and articles following</p>
               <p>That the dignitie made not the miniſter or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop the more honourable but the holines of life and good doctrine.</p>
               <p>That the ſoules ſeparated from the bodies, goe ſtreight way eyther to eternall bleſſedneſſe, or elſe to euerlaſting paines.</p>
               <p>That there is no teſtimonie in all the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which it can be proued that there is any purgatorie after this life.</p>
               <p>For to make oblations and ſacrifices for treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is the inuention of couetous Prieſtes.</p>
               <p>That the images of God or of ſainctes, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of waters, and other like thinges bee forged by men contrarie to the word of God.</p>
               <p>That the order of begging friers were inuented by diuels.</p>
               <p>That baptiſme ought to bee adminiſtred with water, without adding of oyle, ſpittle or ſuch filthi.</p>
               <p>That the Temple of God is the worlde.</p>
               <p>That thoſe which build Temples, Monaſteries, and oratories for to cloaſe him in, doe goe about to locke vp his maieſtie which is incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>That the ornaments of Prieſtes as the chaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, corporals, chalices, platters &amp;c. are but vanity.</p>
               <p>That in vaine do men ſéeke for helpe at the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ſainctes, and that it is but loſt time to ſinge houres canonicall.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:19970:69"/>
               <p>That faſting doeth merite nothing.</p>
               <p>That the euchariſtie ought to bee miniſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kindes.</p>
               <p>They reiected the Maſſe and kept only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the ſupper, the worde, and the prayer, and many other articles drawen out of the holye ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Thus as the moſt parte of the ſchollers of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſitie of Prague did followe Iohn Hus with many moe renoumed in knowledge, and ſo did the moſt part of the nobilitie, the Pope hauing aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a councell at Conſtance, cauſed the Emperour Sigiſmonde to fende for him, who ſent him his ſafe conducte.</p>
               <p>And being there, he was gretly ſollicited to leaue off his opinion: but he was conſtant, vpholding his propoſitions and reaſons, to wit, thoſe which were grounded vppon the trueth of the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Saying that the end &amp; principal ſcope of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was for to teache men repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, according to the trueth of the ſonne of God, &amp; the expoſition of the holy doctours. That if any were able to proue that he did the contrarie, he was ready to acknowledge his faultes: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rather to ſuffer death then leane vnto mens traditions repugning to the doctrine of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>After many diſputations, foraſmuch as hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not all that them liked, he was at the laſte condemned to be burned: &amp; being beſet with woode rounde aboute, as the fire beganne, he cryed thriſe with a loude voyce, O Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God haue pitie on me, and thus he yelded vp the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>His aſhes were caſte by commaundement into Rhein, to the intent that nothinge of him might be left vppon the earth, neuertheleſſe his memory can

               <p>Whoſo woulde ſe thereof more at large, let him reade Iohn Creſpin his booke of martyres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>136</hi> In the yeare after the natiuitie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt <hi>1415.</hi> Hierom of Prague a Bohemia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beinge maruelouſly troubled for that he had heard that his countrie was oppreſſed by houſhoulde eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and neighboures, &amp; by many falſe ſlaunders, and that Iohn Hus was vilanouſly vſed by the ſaid councell, he went to Conſtance, and there being ad uertiſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people went about to entrap him, he retyred backe for certaine daies, vnto a place not farre off, for that he might not ſéeme to intrude him ſelfe wilfully into daungers.</p>
               <p>He requeſted of the Emperour a ſafe conducte for to enter into the cittie, and there to anſwere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch crimes and miſdéedes as ſhoulde be brought againſt him: and ſéeinge that he coulde get no ſafe conduit, he was going home againe, and was taken by the way by treaſon &amp; carried to Conſtance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the preſence of the Biſhopes and prelates he made open confeſſion of his faith.</p>
               <p>True it is that he hauing béen altogeather pined away with longe kéepinge in priſon, and throughe many horrible threatnings, he was vanquiſhed by the weakenes of the fleſh, partly dreadinge the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the torments, and partly hoping to eſcape out of their vilanous and cruell handes, he recited publikely before them all an abiuration which they had giuen him in writing.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he was enioyned to ſay that Iohn Hus had ben worthily burned: but for all this he eſcaped not: but hee returned agayne to the ſame ſtincking and infectuous pryſon where he was afore: being
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19970:70"/>there no better handled then before tyme.</p>
               <p>Then did the lord who neuer forſaketh his, cauſe him to ſeale in his conſcience his vile miſdeed.</p>
               <p>And therefore deſiring to be brought agayne in to the whole aſſembly, he firſt affirmed that he héeld with the Catholike and vniuerſal Church al things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it holdeth, which church abhorreth all errours an hereſies, Laſtly he addeth this, that of all the ſinnes where with he euer had offended Gods diuine maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, there was none that ſo much charged and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his conſcience as did this offence that hee had committed in the chaire of peſtilence and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration: whether he being fallen by infirmitie, and by the horrour of death, he was was conſtrained to goe back, and that he had ſubſcribed to the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Iohn hus, and had ſayed many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that good man and againſt Wiclief, who hee ſaide had openly manifeſted by wordes the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liues of the Biſhops and prelates, had touched them to the quicke in their books hauing iuſtly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſpoken of their miſdéedes and peruerſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>Wherfore he being now by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace and goodnes of God brought to the ſame chaire againe, he vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of that horrible ſinne, and declared that the ſubſcription that he had made was voyde, for they had verie wrongfully burned that holy man.</p>
               <p>In the end he being willed to recant then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or elſe he ſhoulde be vſed as the other was, he choſe rather to dye. And he was condemned to be burned, hauing put on him a crown of paper like as Iohn Hus had, wher on were painted diuels round about. And he ſaide that Ieſus Chriſte for the loue of him a poore ſinner had borne a greater paine, and that for the good will that he had ſhewed him, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo woulde go willingly to execution, and going he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19970:71"/>ſong with prayers, himnes and calling vppon God. And when the woode was ſet about him, hee cryed with a loude voyce, O Lorde into thy handes I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The Bohemians vnderſtanding what was done at Conſtance againſt the doctours, they ſacked and ſpoyled the conuents and monaſteries of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and ſet them on fire, and then they withdrewe them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubiection of the Pope of Rome Looke Naucl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>137</hi> The Realme of Fraunce alſo at that time was not deſtitute of true doctours, who faithfully executed their charge in declaring the light and the day of the Lord, amongſt whom Nicholas Cleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis a doctour of Paris, and Archdeacon of Bayon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, in the yeare <hi>1417.</hi> hath left a certaine teſtimony in wryting touching the corrupt eſtate of the church ſhewing forth the fountaine of all miſchiefes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and calamities that the Church hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and that ſtill it ſhall abide thorough the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible violence, crueltie, tyrannie, and inſatiable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of him, who calleth himſelfe the heade on the the earth, and of his members.</p>
               <p>He ſaide that the ſectes and ſeditions rayſed vp againſt the Churches by the furies of hel do declare what peace &amp; fraternitie they haue amongſt them.

               <p>To conclude, I knowe not how in ſo few words I ſhoulde comprehende, in what a ſtraunge ſort hee ſpeaketh of this fountaine, and the horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

               <p>
                  <hi>138</hi> There is no order nor condition of which god doth not know how to draw ſome to ſend them into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field to battaile, to encounter with falſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours which would ſo ſtoutly &amp; earneſtly maintein ſuperſtitions &amp; abhominable traditions repugning againſt his holy worde. And amongſt others of that time <hi>1418.</hi> the hiſtory of one excellent Lord of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande is worthy to bee recorded with the worthyeſt of the world, to wit, of Iohn Oldeaſtel Lorde Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, knight of the order &amp; one of the péeres of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>He was one of the chiefeſt doctours of his time who taught the courtiers that they ſhoulde ſerue Chriſt better then they did. He was adorned with excellent vertues, and for his noble and vertuous déedes he was promoted to great dignities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>He had this gifte moſt excellent that hee cared not greatly for any glorie and honour of the world, the which doth ſoone fade away, but hee rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounted it all his diguity and felicitie, that he might vndertake to doe ſeruice to the Prince of princes,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19970:72"/>which is Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions of Wiclief ſtoode him in great ſteade. He had ſuch an vnderſtanding of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godlineſſe, that he made no difficultie to receiue vnder his protection al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maintayned the good doctrine, and were in daunger therefore.</p>
               <p>Hee ſuſtayned dyuers times great aſſaultes and daungerous, and chiefely the Machinations and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat practiſes of wicked Byſhops.</p>
               <p>King Henrie the fifte loued him greatly, albeit that he knewe the moſt part of his dealing: but at the laſt hee yelded to the Biſhoppes thorough their falſe reportes, and forſooke this noble knight as the furious appetite of the Archbiſhops and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required.</p>
               <p>He was once or twice cyted by the Archbiſhop: He of long time regarded not his curſes and exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. The king ſent vnto him an Herault, and immediately hee obeyed, and went vnto the king.</p>
               <p>He preſented vnto him his confeſſion written, in which he reciteth by order the articles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> créede, and vpon euery article a brieſe expoſition. The king wolde not receyue this confeſſion. other artycles be founde which he preſented to the Archbiſhop, conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſomme foure poynts, where of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one is that he beleueth, that in the ſacrament of the ſupper we receyue the body of Chriſt vnder the kindes &amp; forme of bread and wine, the ſame body that was borne of the virgin Marie, was crucified, dead and buried, and laſtly roſe againe the third day after his death, and was exalted to the right hand of the father im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and tryumpheth now for euer with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partaker of his eternall glorie.</p>
               <p>And as concernyng the ſacrament that they call penitence or penaunce, he hath written ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

               <p>Concerning their thirde ſacrament he ſaide tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching images, that it doth not appertaine to a true fayth: true it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſince Chriſtian faith was brought into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, they alſo were put in exercyſe thorow permiſſion, to ſerue for a kalender (as they call yt) to the ignorant, to the ende that by the view thereof they mighte the more eaſily ſee the paſſions &amp; holy examples, as well of Chriſt as of his faythfull and holy ſeruantes: but ſythens that there is ſuch abuſe of that repreſentation, and that men do attrybute vnto the images of Saints, that which is due alone vnto him, whom al the ſaintes muſt honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and do put their truſt in them which ought to be tranſſerred to God onely: and more ouer ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are ſo affectioned towards thoſe images, that they like better of and be more deuoute to one them then to another, mine opinion is (ſaid he) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of ſuch do commit Idolatry, and a deadly ſinne againſt God, vnto whom doth belong all honour, glorie, and praiſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly hee ſaide, that hee was thus perſwaded, that there dwelled none here below vpon earth, but was in a pilgrimage, either to goe vnto life, or els to tende vnto torments. That whoſo doth ſo order his life that hee tranſgreſſeth the commaundements &amp; ordinances of God, whither that he knoweth them not, or will not knowe them, hee muſt not hope for ſaluation, albeit that hee raunge abroade to all the corners of ths worlde. Contrariwiſe hee that ſhall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19970:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>kéepe the holy ordinances of God cannot periſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee neuer make voyage nor pilgrimage in his life vnto any place, whither diſordered men haue vſed to goe on pilgrimage.</p>
               <p>There be alſo founde of his other principall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as of the two natures in Chriſt, diuine &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: and that like as his diuinitie was here bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe on earth hidden and couered vnder humanity: ſo in the ſacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Euchariſtie there is bread and the bodie giuen vs, to wit, the breade which we ſée and the bodie of Chriſt which wee ſée not, &amp; thus expreſſed hee his Faith touching the Sacrament &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Alſo that it is not neceſſarie for the obtayning of ſaluation, to confeſſe his ſinnes to his owne Curate or any other prieſt whileſt he liueth.</p>
               <p>Alſo hee denyed not onely the worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, but alſo that which we call the holy Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he ſaide concerning the power of the keyes, and touching the Pope, Archbiſhoppes, Biſhops, and other Prelates, that the Pope is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antichriſt, and that theſe Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Prelates, be his members, and the fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the tayle of Antichriſt, like as the Pope is the heade: to whome no man ought to obey, that is to ſay, to the Pope, Archbiſhops, Biſhoppes, and other Prelats, except they be followers of Chriſt and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in life and manners and in conuerſation: and that hee which is the beſt lyuer &amp; moſt pure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation is the ſucceſſour of Peter, not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>It is reported moreouer that the ſaide Lorde Oldcaſtel ſaide with a loude voyce, ſtretching his handes abroade and perſwading thoſe that were preſent: Theſe who iudge and woulde condemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, will beguile you all, and leade both you &amp; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into hell: and therefore beware of them.</p>

               <p>To make ſhort, ſentence of death was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him, not withſtanding he forbode a while after as it were baniſhed, and was ſent away by a wile. And at the laſt hee being taken againe, and remayning conſtant without denying the trueth which he ſaw conteined in the holy ſcriptures, was condemned to be burned.</p>
               <p>And thus this valiant Doctour and Martyr fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the courſe of his life, and recommending his ſoule vnto God, and praying for his ennimies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hee had exhorted the people to applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the true faith and pure religion, yelded vp his ſpirite vnto the Lord.</p>

               <p>For God hath much more ſince that time ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a clearer chaunge of thinges, cauſing tongue to be renewed as meſſengers, and arts to bee as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners to Dame veritie: who immediately came forth with the brightneſſe of the moſt cleare ſunne, that is, the preaching of the Goſpell, wherein many times they haue excelled, being fortified with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries againſt darkneſſe.</p>

               <p>Being maryed he applied himſelfe to ſtudie and teaching either publikely or priuately, labouring to profite all men.</p>
               <p>At the laſte hee was taken in the citie of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich: and there they layed againſt him thirtie arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for the which hee was cruelly burned by the

               <p>In the Realme of Bohemia Paul Crau in the yeare <hi>1431.</hi> was deliuered to the ſeculer power by a Biſhoppe for to bee burned, and that becauſe hee blodly withſtoode the wicked opinions of the people touching the Euchariſtie, inuocation of ſainctes, auricular confeſſion and other articles.</p>
               <p>Of the kingdome of Fraunce, Thomas Readon of the order of Carmelites, who hauing knowledge of the trueth was by occaſion at Rome, whereas hée perceiued to be naught els but filthines &amp; al maner hypocriſie in ſteede of perfect holyneſſe: proud para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes in ſtead of heauenly graces: in ſtead of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of God, execrable diſſolutenes: in ſteade of doctrine, idleneſſe &amp; horrible ſuperſtitions: in ſteade of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall ſimplicitie worſe then barbarous tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>

               <p>Moreouer it is ſaide that this good man amongſt other thinges was greatly gréeued at the pride and intollerable ambition that hee ſawe in them who ought to ſhew themſelues more humble then others, ſéeing in Rome ſuch abhominable thinges as are horrible to be named.</p>
               <p>So that this good man coulde not refraine from ſpeaking againſt ſuch villanous corruptions: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that hee knewe well that his admonitions and counſell would not profite much.

               <p>He gate hatred by his preaching, ſparing none: ſhewing euery bodie their faults, and eſpecially the horrible miſdemeanour of the Cardinals.</p>

               <p>Furthermore that the Pope did neither followe the life nor doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, forſomuch as he attributed more to his pardons, indulgences, and to his owne traditions, then hee did to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Ieſus Chriſt, and that therefore he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>He affirmed alſo that the excommunications of the Pope were not to be feared. Look in the booke of martyrs.</p>

               <p>He after that he had ſpent ſome time in ſtudie of the ciuill lawe, went contrarie to the opinion of his parentes and friendes to a conuent of Auguſtins.</p>

               <p>He declared that the commaundement of Chriſt was to teach the Goſpell, and that the proper office
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19970:77"/>of Biſhoppes is to inſtruct the people, praying the Archbiſhop that according to his dutie hee woulde vſe his authoritie in prohibiting certaine bookes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome had publiſhed in defence of the foreſaide facte, and that thoſe preachers might followe a better kinde of doctrine.</p>

The Archbiſhop aunſwered nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

               <p>He aunſwered worthely in that excellent aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yéelding a good reaſon for the bookes that he had compoſed: he prayed and beſought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that if there were any man that had ought to ſay againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine whereof he made profeſſion, that he would not diſſimule it: but that he woulde vtter &amp; ſhewe forth his fault by teſtimonies of the holy ſcripture: that he woulde be no Schiſmatike, but woulde rather be the firſt that ſhoulde ſet his bookes on fire.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed that the trueth is cauſe of troubles. And that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſaid, that it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for the Goſpel to moue great debates and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations amongeſt ſuch as ſticke ouer much to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and to their kinſefolkes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he there warned the Emperour and all the princes to thinke grauely and with aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente howe they ought to deale and foreſee, leaſt in condemning the doctrine offered them through a ſingular benefite of God they ſhoulde cauſe a great plague to hapen vnto all Germanie.</p>
               <p>After many aduertiſementes, and being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whither he would mainteine his bookes or not, he aunſwered by and by, that he woulde not reuoke any thing of that whiche hee had either written or taught, except he were vanquiſhed by teſtimonie of the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>The ſentence of the Emperour was againſt him and ſo were the aſſembly of princes, ſaying, that his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19970:78"/>aunceſtours had obeyed the Church of Rome, and ſo woulde he, and yet in the meane while he kepte his promiſe made vnto Luther, ſo he ſent him agayne ſafe and ſounde to the place where he abode.</p>
               <p>Luther was kept ſecret by certaine of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt princes. He was accuſed that his bookes rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great troubles. He was threatened that if he ſtoode ſtiffe in his opinions he coulde not ſoiourne in any place of Germaine: but he feared not any of their meaninges, nor for all the hurtes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they ſayde might by his meanes happen: ſubmitting himſelfe to endure death rather then to forſake the worde of God ſo apparant.</p>
               <p>Then he pronounced openly that he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued all the councels, as ſome reported, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the councell of Conſtance, becauſe that it conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the worde of God, as appeareth in the article of Iohn Hus, which was condemned: that is, that the Church of Ieſus Chriſte is the communion of the predeſtinate. The councell of Conſtance condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this article, and ſo by conſequence condemned this article of our faith. I beléeue the holy vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, proteſting then that hee refuſed not to ſpend his life &amp; bloud, ſo as he might not be brought to this neceſſitie for to denie the manifeſt worde of God: for in mainteining thereof he muſt rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God then men.</p>
               <p>Concerning offence he anſwered, that is double, to wit, of charitie, and of faith: The offence of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie conſiſteth in manners and in life, and is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſhunned. That of faith or of doctrine, it lieth in the worde of God, and it ought not to be feared, ſéeing that the trueth and will of the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that he hath commaunded ought not to be diſſanulled, although the whole worlde ſhoulde be thereat offended. Chriſt in the ſcripture is named
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19970:79"/>a ſtumbling ſtone, which thing doth appertaine to all thoſe that preach the goſpell.</p>
               <p>He ſaide that hee refuſed not to obey the lawes and the magiſtrate, like as he proteſted that hee had alwayes taught the people to doe, and as his kooks did witneſſe howe greatly he eſtéemed the dignitie of lawes: but that it was otherwiſe of decrées and ſtatutes eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p>He aunſwered alſo that he refuſed not to ſubmit his bookes to the iudgement of the Emperour or to the eſtates of the Empire, and to the iudgement of other men ſo that they woulde iudge by conduct of the worde of God, the which hee ſaide was beſt: that if they coulde not reproue him of errour, hee coulde not chaunge his opinion. For S. Paul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs that we ſhall not beléeue an Angell comming from heauen, if he bring any other Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               <p>And to be ſhorte, he was ſolicited, menaced, and aſſaulted on all ſortes, yea euen of all other Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, countries and prouinces. The kinge of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, Henrie the eight wrot againſt him, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued his iudgement concerning indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and other pointes. Luther anſwered him. Pope Leo thundered againſt him a long proces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him as an heretike. To conclude, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and abode with paine and trauaile the moſte bitter and terrible aſſaults and combates that any man of his time did: ſaying alwayes in the ende, that he was readie rather to looſe his life, then to forſake the worde of GOD, which is ſo manifeſt, wherevppon he grounded his reaſons which he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered foorth. That if any coulde ſhewe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, all that he ſhoulde finde not conformable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeing to the trueth, he woulde be readie to reuoke in any parte aſwell of his writinges as Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:19970:79"/>
               <p>Therfore thoſe do falſely accuſe him, that ſay he was led with ambition &amp; fantaſtical opinion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might winne praiſe, and pleaſe the princes of Germaine, ſo as afterwarde he might chaunge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the eſtate politik. But is this an ambition? a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption? is this to ſéeke to be in great dignitie and exalted to honour, and to liue more delicately then within a cloyſter, when a man knoweth that hee muſt willingly go into a moſt dangerous were? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to terrible and cruel tormentes of death, as this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonage might well enough knowe by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and others good and faithfull perſonages, who had come thereto?</p>
               <p>Others ſaide that he was poſſeſſed with a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine madneſſe that he might inuenim the world with deadly poyſon: But I will not ſay any more to aunſwere ſuch ſclaunderers and backbiters who doe gaine ſay them who they do manifeſtly perceiue haue ſought the true doctrine of the word of GOD, the which they haue preached and written, &amp; which haue had the grace of GOD for to liue and die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for the mainteinance thereof.</p>
               <p>But thoſe men think in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, being inueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the ſerpentine poyſon of the deuiliſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, as by their fruites and workes ſtuffed with impietie, vilanie and infection may eaſilie bee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and that which is contrarie to the honour of God and to the truth of his holy word, to diſgorge their ſtincking vomit, yea all the miſchief that they can deuiſe by any ſubtill meane, like as the diuell putteth into their heades ſo that what is it that they dare not doe.</p>

               <p>I wil not recite any more of this holy perſonage. He departed out of this life in the yeare of our Lord <hi>1546.</hi> hauing commended his ſoule into the handes of God, and was buried honourably at Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge.</p>
               <p>Hee that wil ſee further of his life and deeds, let him reade the booke of Martyrs: alſo Sleidan and Melancthon haue deſcribed his life and geſtes.</p>
               <p>Huldrike Zuinglius was borne about the yere <hi>1427.</hi> and when hee had trauailed a long time as well in the liberall artes as in the ſtudie of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie: He imployed his ſtudie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſchoole of dyuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he perceiued that that was but loſſe of time, and that thorough worldly wiſdome, God and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie were brued together: ſo that of ſuch pratling, barbarouſnes, vaine glorie, and other like thinges were riſen and did grow, and no hope of ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine coulde be hoped for thereby.</p>
               <p>He abode there notwithſtanding, as one that had eſpied the campe of his enimies, vntill the people of Glaris choſe him for their miniſter, before that he entred orders which hee gat afterwarde, for then he had not knowledg of the trueth.</p>
               <p>Hauing entred into the miniſterie he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly to ſtudie, eſpecially of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for he then eſtéemed not humaine wrytings but ſo as they might ſtand with the holy ſcriptures and for preachings.</p>
               <p>He was purpoſed for to learne Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19970:80"/>without book, becauſe of memorable examples that be therein.</p>
               <p>He ſawe that theſe be thinges required of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, that hee hath charge to teache the flocke of Chriſt, that he be adorned with knowledge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things, and aboue all with diuine knowledge, then with the grace of ſpeaking wel, for to expound all things fitlie, according as may ſerue for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie and capacitie of euery bodie.</p>
               <p>For diſcharge of his dutie he was dayly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the olde and newe Teſtament, ſhewing the proprieties of the text, &amp; applying them according as he ſawe profitable for them of that countrie.</p>
               <p>Hee applyed himſelfe to the knowledge of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and learning at Saint Peter, that the holy ſcripture is not vnderſtoode by one particuler inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, he lifted vp his eyes on hygh, crauing for the holy ghoſt to be his teacher, and praying dayly that he might obtaine the grace that he might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to haue true vnderſtanding by ſence of the holy ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Hee iudged of the Catholike Doctours as they iudged of themſelues, that they muſt be reade with iudgment and be examined by the canonicall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as by the touchſtone: that otherwiſe by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them Philoſophie and humaine reaſons, they were commonly ſo corrupted, that there is no meane how to make them agrée with the authority of the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Then he put his knowledge in practiſe ſo that hee interpriſed the battle againſt the greateſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. Thereof came hatred, raylings, clamors, ambuſhmentes of the children of this worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy ſeruant of God Zuinglius.</p>
               <p>Hee went thence and afterwarde was ſent for from Zurich to Suiſſa to be the Paſtour, &amp; being
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19970:81"/>placed, hee immediately after vttered forth in the chapter of the Chanons that which he had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to teach the people: to wit, the hiſtorie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt after S. Matthew, to the intent that the vertue of him, whoſe title ought to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, ſhoulde not lye buried, to the detriment of the glorie of God, and to the ſaluation of ſoules.</p>
               <p>He proteſted that he did not expounde it by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſence, nor yet being bounde to the methode of any interpretour, but by conference and a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent collection of the holy ſcriptures and by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the ſpirite: the which he hoped to obtaine by praying hartely vnto God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is reported of him that hee kept a very good order in preaching, and that the ſimple might as well profite thereby as the beſt learned, ſo as the hearer coulde hardely goe away but being more wiſe and enriched with knowledg of the Lord then he had afore.</p>
               <p>And like as hee taught the trueth openly &amp; with great diligence, ſo was he hardie and earneſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue vices, crying againſt the oppreſſions of the poore, againſt idle perſons, dronkards, gluttons, and others liuing in pleaſures and vaine delights, and ſuperfluities.</p>
               <p>Shortly after was ſent thither from the Pope a preacher of pardons named Sampſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Millanois, for to bribe and poll, againſt whom Zuinglius ſtoode ſtoutly, &amp; proued him a deceiuer &amp; naughtie fellow.</p>
               <p>Zuinglius was menaced, and the ill will of the enemies of the trueth inuenimed dayly more and more, that many as wel in the citie as in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in their ſermons diffamed his doctrine, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked and not catholike. And amongſt others the Iacobins were the chiefe. Zuinglius contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mainteined it conformed to the holy ſcripturs,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19970:81"/>and went about to ſet it forth.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Senate of Zurich ſent about the yeare <hi>1523.</hi> to all the miniſters of the Churches within the iuriſdiction to appeare at the ſaide cytie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>29.</hi> of Ianuarie, for to accorde of certeine diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about religion: promiſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euery man ſhould be heard ſo much and ſo long as ſhould be requiſite.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſaide Senate did friendly intreat by letters the biſhoppe of Conſtance to come thither or els to ſende ſome of his people.</p>
               <p>After that a great multitude of people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at the day appointed, and alſo Iohn Faber the Biſhops great Vicar come, The Conſull carued vp the matter, ſaying, that the aſſemblie had bene cyted becauſe of the great diſſention of doctrin that was rayſed vp: to the intent that if any bodie woulde ſay any thing againſt the doctrine of Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius he ſhould willingly vtter it forth. And ye muſt note y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> before this time Zuinglius had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his doctrine in <hi>70.</hi> &amp; ſeuen articles: &amp; had publiſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they might al come wel fortified to this aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly &amp; diſputation. The conſul for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding of his purpoſe, bad them confer &amp; diſpute together.</p>
               <p>Then the ſaide Faber after that he had declared wherfore he was ſent, laboured to perſwade them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there was no place to decide thoſe matters: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it ſhuld be done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel which ſhuld be kept there.</p>
               <p>Zuinglius on the contrary preſſed them on, that they ſhould make no delaye if he had any thinge to lay againſt him.</p>
               <p>To whom he anſwered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he would refute his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by writing.</p>
               <p>And after much adoe on both ſids, when as none wold offer to beginne the diſputations, they left the aſſembly: and then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senat cauſed to be proclaymed thorough al that countrie, that forſaking mans tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19970:82"/>they ſhoulde preach ſincerely thegoſpell, the old and newe teſtament.</p>
               <p>Then were great contentions amongſt the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſes about religion: hatred burned then euery day more &amp; more, in ſuch ſort that the other partes ſent to Zurich by ambaſſage giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand of their ill caſe.</p>
               <p>The men of Zurich made anſwere ſhewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ineſtimable benefits and graces that God did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt other people beſtowe vppon them.</p>
               <p>And that ſéeing they had the worde of God gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, they ſhoulde not feare any threatenings. They gaue commandement that throughout all the precincte of their iuriſdiction all the images ſhould be taken away and burned, which thing was done without anie tumult the <hi>13.</hi> day of Iune, in the yeare <hi>1524.</hi> Within a certaine while after thoſe that be called Chanons made certaine partes or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenantes with the Senate, and it was conſulted howe the goods &amp; reuenewes of the chapiter ſhould be imployed.</p>
               <p>And about the <hi>13.</hi> of Aprill in the yeare <hi>1525.</hi> by the commaundement of the councell, the maſſe was vtterly aboliſhed at Zurich, &amp; through all that ſeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieurie: and in ſtéed thereof the Lordes ſupper was inſtituted. Ceremonies alſo were chaunged to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the prophets, to prayer and to the preaching of the word. Whoredome and adultrie was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and iudges deputed for to know ſhe affaires of mariage.</p>
               <p>The prieſtes and monkes &amp;c. were caſt out of the dores: many laboured by ſundrie meanes to put Zuinglius to death: his houſe was beſette in the night time for to haue taken him.</p>
               <p>He was aſſaulted on all ſids as well by writing, as otherwiſe: He withſtoode the opinions of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtes,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19970:82"/>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which in his time began to ſpring vp.</p>
               <p>He compoſed many bookes and commentaries v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>He died in the battaile that was rayſed vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of linings betwixt the fiue ſmal coaſtes &amp; the people of Zurich. For the cuſtome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inhabitants of Zurich is ſuch, that when they march to battaile the chiefe miniſter muſt be in the troupe. Look Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan and Oſwald Micorinis who haue written hys life and actes at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>141</hi> Oecolampadius of Germaine being of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of Monkes of the order of S. Bridgide, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding libertie for his ſtudie and faith, beſides certaine ſermons that he wrot, he publiſhed alſo a booke of confeſſion very chriſtian like, and therefore intollerable amongſt themarchants of ceremonies. For becauſe of this booke one that was a confeſſour of the Emperour brought him into greate daunger when as the eſtates of the Empire were aſſembled at Wormes.</p>
               <p>He departed out of that cloyſter and went vnto a noble &amp; worthie man Francis de Sickingen: he began to amend againe the abuſe of the maſſe, and tranſlated certain fragments out of Chriſoſtom:</p>
               <p>Afterward he was at Baſile, thinking to haue put in print that he had compoſed. There by the wil of the Senat &amp; councel of the citie, notwithſtanding the clamoures of Sophiſters, he began to read I ſaie publikelie: and ſhortly after at the requeſte of the Curate of S. Martins, he toke in hand the charge of a preacher in his roume, not without great deſpyte of thoſe that mainteined the traditions of the Pope.</p>
               <p>He preached the holy Goſpell of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt fiue yeares without wage either of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or preacher. He had great knowledge in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers languages, as the workes of Theophilactus,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19970:83"/>Cyrillus; and Chriſoſtom vpon Geneſis do witnes.</p>
               <p>There happened in that time a diſputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the euchariſtie, and being requeſted to ſay his opinion thereof, he did it modeſtly according to the iudgement of the Elders, whom he alleadged faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: wherevppon grewe a great debate, by meane that others did not take that which he had written in ſuch ſort as he ment.</p>
               <p>Faber Eclzius and others appointed a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Suiſſes to be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Bade, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he alone ſuſteined the cauſe of the trueth againſt the aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>He made many good commentaries vpon Eſay, Ieremie, Agge, Zacharie, Malachie, Daniell, Iob, Ezechiel, vpon the Epiſtles of S. Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines and to the Hebrewes, vppon the Goſpell of S. Iohn and vpon the Canonicall epiſtle.</p>
               <p>He departed out of this life at the end of Noue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the yeare <hi>1531.</hi> Whoſo wil read more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his life let him read Simon Gryneus, Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangus, &amp; the booke of Martyrs.</p>
               <p>Bucer a learned man was alſo in the time of Luther and Zuinglius, hee gaue alſo greate light throughout all Chriſtendome, not only by pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but alſo by holineſſe of life. Iohn Caluin in the preface of his comentaries vppon the Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Romaines, ſpeaking of certaine good deuines of that time, and naming expreſly Bucer, ſaith of him in theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>This man beſides the profounde and excellent knowledge that he had in many matters, beſids the fine wit, and that he had read much, and beſids ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſundrie vertues that he had, in which none at this preſent doth excell him, yea few comparable to him, had this prayſe proper and particular, that none of his time applyed himſelfe more to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19970:83"/>of the holy ſcripturs and that with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence then he.</p>
               <p>He was ſent for from Strauſbourg to refourme the Churches of Colloine. He preached to the godly being in great daunger amongeſt the Spaniards: at that time the Emperour came down through Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in who by his ambaſſadours did earneſtly intreate the Archbiſhop to giue him libertie.</p>
